1. Smart Contract

Smart contracts are the building blocks for blockchain-based applications. These are based on the concept of contractual governance of transactions involving two or more parties. Instead of relying on a central authority, it can be checked programmatically using the blockchain.

2. Permissioned Blockchain

Permissioned blockchain is a distributed ledger that is not publicly accessible. Users with permissions are the only ones who can access it. Permissioned blockchains provide an additional level of security over typical blockchain systems. Users can only conduct actions that the ledger administrators have permitted them, and they must identify themselves via certificates or other digital means.
